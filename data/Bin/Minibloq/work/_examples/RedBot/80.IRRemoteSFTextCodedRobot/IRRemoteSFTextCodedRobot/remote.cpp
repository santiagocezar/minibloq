   This sketch uses Ken Shirriff's *awesome* IRremote library:
       https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote

   RGB Remote Control uses a combination of SparkFun's 
   IR Remote (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11759) and an
   IR receiver diode (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10266) to
   control an RGB LED.

   The IR Remote's power button turns the LED on or off. The A, B, 
   and C buttons select a channel (red, green, or blue). The up
   and down arrows increment or decrement the LED brightness on that channel.
   The left and right arrows turn a channel to min or max, and
   circle set it to the middle.

   Hardware setup:
     * The output of an IR Receiver Diode (38 kHz demodulating
       version) should be connected to the Arduino's pin 11.
       * The IR Receiver diode should also be powered off the
         Arduino's 5V and GND rails.
     * A common cathode RGB LED is connected to Arduino's pins 
       5, 9, and 6 (red, green, and blue pins).
